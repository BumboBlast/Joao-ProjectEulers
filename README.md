Project Eulers for Joao

01 Multiples of 3 and 5

  -> very cool (:
        Problems:
            -'!' and '!=' not working
            -couldn't get if/else to function right
            -noticed that print() also prints "\n" by default
                 

02 Even Fibonacci numbers

  -> yes (:

        Problems:
            -puting numbers in variable names does not work
