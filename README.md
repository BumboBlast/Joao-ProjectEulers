Project Eulers for Joao

01 Multiples of 3 and 5

  -> very cool (:
  
        Problems:
            -'!' and '!=' not working
            -couldn't get if/else to function right
            -noticed that print() also prints "\n" by default
                 

02 Even Fibonacci numbers

  -> yes (:

        Problems:
            -puting numbers in variable names does not work


03 Large prime factor

        Problems:
            -print("this loop happens ", increment, " times\n");
              this gives the following error: UNTERMINATED STRING
              oh, "\n" isnt a thing. 

            -issue was caused by '%' requiring both operands to be the same type
               double % double  as opposed to int % int
               no error message, just hang infinitley, so I assume its a bug.
